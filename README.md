# DEND-Projects
Projects create for the DATA ENGINEERING NANO DEGREE from Udacity

## Project 1 - Data Modeling with Postgres
In this project I created a database and an ETL pipeline in Postgres for a music streaming app.
## Project 2 - Data Warehouse
In this project I built an ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for the analytics team.
