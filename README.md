# DEND-Projects
Projects create for the DATA ENGINEERING NANO DEGREE from Udacity

## Project 1 - Data Modeling with Postgres
In this project I created a database and an ETL pipeline in Postgres for a music streaming app.
## Project 2 - Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
In this particular project I modeled event data to create a non-relational database and WTL pipeline for a music streaming app/ Defined queries and tables for a database built using Apache Cassandra.
## Project 3 - Data Warehouse
In this project I built an ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for the analytics team.
## Project 4 - Data Lake
For this project I built, as requested, a data lake and an ETL pipeline in Spak that loads data from s3, processes the data into analytics tables, and loads them back into S3.
